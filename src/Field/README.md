# Field

The Field solution provides a microservice (REST API), reusable Razor pages, and a Blazor Server web application to manage Field data, display field trajectories and survey runs, maintain field-level vocabularies and delineation lines, and run contextual calculators. It also includes shared models and generators for OpenAPI-based clients used across the solution.

## Purpose

- Expose CRUD APIs for Field data and managed vocabularies, versioned batch export, plus synchronous stateless field coordinate conversion.
- Expose an MCP endpoint for Field CRUD, portable batch transfer, and stateless conversion, with optional MCP hub registration from the shared `home/` volume.
- Provide a web UI to browse and edit fields, manage field vocabularies, maintain delineation lines, display field-level trajectories and survey runs, and run cartographic, vertical datum, Earth gravity, and Earth magnetic-field calculations.
- Share OpenAPI-generated clients/DTOs to keep contracts consistent across Service, WebApp, and tests.

Field writes validate every reference to the locally owned feature, membership,
identity, and delineation-line-type catalogs. A referenced catalog definition or
option cannot be deleted, and a category update cannot remove an option still in
use. Conflicts identify the affected Field UUIDs. PUT operations are full
replacements and require `expectedModifiedUtc` from the latest representation;
stale updates return HTTP 409 without changing stored data.

## Installation

Prerequisites:
- .NET SDK 8.0+
- Optional: Docker (for containerized runs)

Steps (dev):
- Restore and build the solution:
  - `dotnet restore`
  - `dotnet build Field.sln`
- Generate/refresh the NSwag client and merged OpenAPI (optional during dev):
  - `dotnet run --project ModelSharedOut`
- Run the Service:
  - `dotnet run --project Service`
  - Base path: `https://localhost:5001/Field/api` and `http://localhost:5002/Field/api`
- Run the WebApp:
  - `dotnet run --project WebApp`
  - Base path: `https://localhost:5011/Field/webapp` and `http://localhost:5012/Field/webapp`

Configuration:
- Service reads `EarthCartographicProjectionHostURL` and `EarthGeodesyHostURL` (see `Service/appsettings.*.json`).
- Service can read optional external configuration from `home/Field.Service.json`, or from the path specified by `FIELD_EXTERNAL_CONFIG`.
- WebApp reads `FieldHostURL`, `ClusterHostURL`, `RigHostURL`, `TrajectoryHostURL`, `EarthCartographicProjectionHostURL`, `EarthGeodesyHostURL`, `EarthGravityHostURL`, `EarthMagneticFieldHostURL`, `EarthVerticalDatumHostURL`, and `UnitConversionHostURL`.

Code generation:
- When a pinned EarthCartographicProjection or EarthGeodesy contract changes, run `dotnet run --project ModelSharedIn` and commit its schemas and generated outputs.
- When a Field model or controller contract changes, run `dotnet build Service/Service.csproj -c Debug` to refresh `ModelSharedOut/json-schemas/FieldFullName.json`, then run `dotnet run --project ModelSharedOut` and commit the generated outputs.

## Usage Examples

Swagger UI (Service):
- Local: `https://localhost:5001/Field/api/swagger` (merged schema served at `/Field/api/swagger/merged/swagger.json`)
- Dev example: `https://dev.digiwells.no/Field/api/swagger`

Quick curl (create a Field):
```
curl -k -X POST "https://localhost:5001/Field/api/Field" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "MetaInfo": { "ID": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" },
    "Name": "My Field",
    "Description": "Sample"
  }'
```

Batch export every field into a versioned JSON document:
```
curl -k -X POST "https://localhost:5001/Field/api/Field/BatchExport" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "Scope": "All" }' \
  --output fields.json
```

Use `Scope: "Selected"` with a non-empty, unique `FieldIDs` array to export
specific fields in the requested order. The complete request fails if any UUID
is empty, duplicated, or absent. An `All` export is ordered by UUID for stable
output. The version-2 document identifies itself as
`OSDC.Drilling.Field.BatchExport` and contains complete Field records together
with the referenced Field Feature, Field Membership, Field Identity and
Delineation Line Type definitions. Projection definitions remain external
resources identified by UUID.

Atomically restore that document without overwriting existing fields:
```
curl -k -X POST "https://localhost:5001/Field/api/Field/BatchRestore" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- <<'JSON'
{
  "ConflictPolicy": "FailIfExists",
  "CatalogPolicy": "MapOrCreateMissing",
  "Document": {
    "FormatIdentifier": "OSDC.Drilling.Field.BatchExport",
    "SchemaVersion": 2,
    "ExportedAtUtc": "2026-08-27T12:00:00Z",
    "CatalogDependencies": {
      "FeatureCategories": [],
      "MembershipCategories": [],
      "Identities": [],
      "DelineationLineTypes": []
    },
    "Fields": [
      {
        "MetaInfo": { "ID": "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111" },
        "Name": "My Field"
      }
    ]
  }
}
JSON
```

`FailIfExists` rejects the whole batch if any UUID is already stored.
`ReplaceExisting` inserts missing fields and replaces existing fields in the
same transaction. Format, version, UTC timestamp, field identities, duplicate
UUIDs, and projection UUIDs are validated before writing. A storage failure at
any position rolls back every earlier write. `MapExisting` resolves catalog
UUIDs by compatible local UUID or a unique normalized-name match and rejects
missing definitions. `MapOrCreateMissing` additionally creates missing local
definitions and options with server-generated UUIDs. Catalog matching,
reference rewriting, catalog creation and field restoration are atomic.

WebApp (UI):
- Local Field page: `https://localhost:5011/Field/webapp/Field`
- Dev example: `https://dev.digiwells.no/Field/webapp/Field`
- Managed vocabulary pages:
  - `/Field/webapp/FieldFeatures`
  - `/Field/webapp/FieldMemberships`
  - `/Field/webapp/FieldIdentities`
  - `/Field/webapp/FieldDelineationLineTypes`
- Batch backup and restore: `/Field/webapp/FieldBackupRestore`
- Hosted Cluster list/editor: `/Field/webapp/Cluster`; other Cluster package pages are intentionally not routed by the Field webapp.

MCP server:
- Streamable HTTP: `/Field/api/mcp`
- WebSocket: `/Field/api/mcp/ws`
- Conversion tools are `field_forward_convert_coordinates` and `field_inverse_convert_coordinates`; requests and results are never persisted.
- Portable transfer tools are `field_batch_export` and `field_batch_restore`. The restore tool is marked destructive and exposes the schema-version-2 catalog mapping/creation policies and atomic transaction contract.
- Usage statistics remain available through REST and are intentionally not exposed as an MCP tool.
- Optional MCP hub registration is configured with `McpHub` in `Field.Service.json`; MCP URLs are derived from `McpHub:PublicBaseUrl`.
